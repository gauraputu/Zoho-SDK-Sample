This sample code shows how to fetch data on node.js using Zoho CRM SDK.
We Create this sample code because [Zoho documentation](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/server-side-sdks/v2/node-js.html) is tough to understand.
Hopefully, this example made it easier for other developers to use Zoho SDK on their apps.

# Pre-requisite
You should have a client ID, Client Secret, and either grant token/refresh token (or both) already made from [Zoho Api Console](https://api-console.zoho.com)
then put it all in the **.env** file
